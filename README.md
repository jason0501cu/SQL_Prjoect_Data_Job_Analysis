* Do highly demanded skills correlate with high-paying jobs?

### Data Source ðŸ““

### Points to Note

The job postings from Singapore that have salaries listed in the data set are very limited (only 27 observations). Apart from this, the data set has been checked to be clean and fair by me, so no additional data cleaning process is implemented. The data limitation will be addressed in the analysis by referencing the overall data as a proxy.

All data on salary is in US dollars.
